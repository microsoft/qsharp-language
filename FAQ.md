# Frequently Asked Questions

### *How do I make a suggestion for a feature?*

Please create a new issue following on our suggestion template.

### *Can I help implement a feature?*

Yes! Please take a look at the proposals that have been approved in principle and are ready for implementation. If a feature is under active development a corresponding open issue tagged with `Implementation` exists on this repository, and otherwise the development has not yet started. If you would like to help with the implementation of a feature that is already being developed, please comment on the corresponding issue to indicate your interest. If you would like to implement a feature for which development has not yet started, please create an issue following our implementation template. Once the issue is created, we will respond to follow up with a discussion to flesh out the details of the implementation. 

### *Why has my suggestion been declined?*

There are many reasons why a suggestion may be declined. Q# is a domain specific language for a rather unique domain, and unfortunately, not everything that works well on classical hardware works well for execution on quantum devices. Please take a look a the Q# design principles as well as the document giving some guidance on good practices for further details on what considerations we factor into our decisions.

### *How can I use and get development tools for Q#?*

Q# is part of the Quantum Development Kit shipped by Microsoft. Please take a look at the documentation for further instructions on what tools are available and how to install them. 

### *Where can I learn more about quantum development and/or quantum computing?*

There are a lot of good resources, and we will list but a few suggestions to help you get started.
