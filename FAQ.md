# Frequently Asked Questions

### *How do I make a suggestion for a feature?*

Please create a new issue following on our [suggestion template](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language/issues/new?template=suggestion.md).

### *Can I help implement a feature?*

Yes! Please take a look at the proposals that have been [approved in principle](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language/tree/main/Approved) and are ready for implementation. If a feature is under active development a corresponding open issue labeled with `Implementation` exists on this repository, and otherwise the development has not yet started. If you would like to help with the implementation of a feature that is already [being developed](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language/labels/Implementation), please comment on the corresponding issue to indicate your interest. If you would like to implement a feature for which development has not yet started, please create an issue following our [implementation template](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language/issues/new?template=implementation.md). Once the issue is created, we will respond to follow up with a discussion to flesh out the details of the implementation. 

### *Why has my suggestion been declined?*

There are many reasons why a suggestion may be declined. Q# is a domain specific language for a rather unique domain, and unfortunately, not everything that works well on classical hardware works well for execution on quantum devices. Please take a look a the [Q# design principles](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language#design-principles) as well as other [considerations](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language/blob/main/Guidelines.md) we factor into our decisions.

### *How can I use Q# and where do I get development tools?*

Q# is part of the [Quantum Development Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/quantum/development-kit) shipped by Microsoft. Please take a look at the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/) for further instructions on what tools are available and how to [install](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/quickstarts/) them. 

### *Where can I learn more about quantum development and/or quantum computing?*

There are a lot of good resources, and we will list but a few suggestions to help you get started.
