# Declined Language Proposals

This folder contains the proposals for features that have been declined. While we do our best to give early feedback regarding whether or not a feature aligns with the general vision for Q# and the Q# language design principles, in some cases the decision is ultimately made based the more detailed considerations that are part of a full proposal. These proposals are archived here for future reference.
