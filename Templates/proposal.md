# QEP 0: Title

## Proposal

TODO:    
Insert a short outline for what the proposal is. 

## Justification

TODO:    
Explain why this modification to the Q# language is needed or desirable.    
Explain both the benefit of the proposed modification as well as briefly summarize the benefits of the chosen mechanism opposed to other ways of achieving a similar functionality. 

## Description

TODO:    
Describe the proposal and how it ties in with other aspects of the Q# language in more detail.    
Provide general information about the relevant mechanisms and their role in Q#, and how the proposal relates to them. 

### Current Status

TODO:   
Describe all aspects of the current version of Q# that will be impacted by the proposed modification.     
Describe in detail the current behavior or limitations that make the proposed change necessary.      
Describe how the targeted functionality can be achieved with the current version of Q#.    
Refer to the examples given below to illustrate your descriptions. 

#### Examples

Example 1:    
TODO: insert title and caption

```qsharp
// TODO: 
// Insert code example that illustrates what is described above.
// Comment your code to further elaborate and clarify the example.

```
TODO:   
Add more examples following the structure above. 

### Proposed Modification

TODO:    
Describe how the proposed modification changes the behavior and/or syntax described in [Current Status](#current-status).   
Describe in detail how the proposed modification is supposed to behave how it is supposed to be used.    
Describe in detail any impact on existing code and how to interpret all new language structures.    
Refer to the code examples below to illustrate your descriptions. 

#### Examples

Example 1:    
TODO: insert title and caption

```qsharp
// TODO: 
// Insert code example that illustrates what is described above.
// Comment your code to further elaborate and clarify the example.

```
TODO:   
Add more examples following the structure above. 

## Implementation

TODO:    
Describe how the made proposal could be implemented and why it should be implemented in this way.    
Be specific regarding the efficiency, and potential caveats of such an implementation.    
Based on that description a user should be able to determine when to use or not to use the proposed modification and how.

### Timeline

TODO:    
List any dependencies that the proposed implementation relies on.    
Estimate the resources required to accomplish each step of the proposed implementation. 

## Further Considerations

TODO:    
Provide any context and background information that is needed to discuss the concepts in detail that are related to or impacted by your proposal.

### Related Mechanisms

TODO:    
Provide detailed information about the mechanisms and concepts that are relevant for or related to your proposal,
as well as their role, realization and purpose within Q#. 

### Impact on Existing Mechanisms

TODO:    
Describe in detail the impact of your proposal on existing mechanisms and concepts within Q#. 

### Anticipated Interactions with Future Modifications

TODO:    
Describe how the proposed modification ties in with possible future developments of Q#.
Describe what developments it can facilitate and/or what functionalities depend on the proposed modification.

### Alternatives

TODO:    
Explain alternative mechanisms that would serve a similar purpose as the proposed modification.    
For each one, discuss what the implications are for the future development of Q#.

### Comparison to Alternatives

TODO:    
Compare your proposal to the possible alternatives and compare the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. 
Compare in particular their impact on the future development of Q#.
