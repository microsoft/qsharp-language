# Arithmetic Expressions

Arithmetic operators are addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), negation (`-`), exponentiation (`^`). 
They can be applied to operands of type `Int`, `BigInt`, or `Double`. Additionally, for integral types (`Int` and `BigInt`) an operator computing the modulus (`%`) is available. For binary operators, the type of both operands has to match, expect for exponentiation; an exponent for a value of type `BigInt` always has to be of type `Int`. The type of the entire expression matches the type of the left operand. 

Division and modulus for values of type `Int` and `BigInt` follow the following behavior for
negative numbers:

 `A` | `B` | `A / B` | `A % B`
---------|----------|---------|---------
 5 | 2 | 2 | 1
 5 | -2 | -2 | 1
 -5 | 2 | -2 | -1
 -5 | -2 | 2 | -1

That is, `a % b` will always have the same sign as `a`,
and `b * (a / b) + a % b` will always equal `a`.

Q# does not support any automatic conversions between arithmetic data types - or any other data types for that matter. This is of importance especially for the `Result` data type, and facilitates to restrict how runtime information can propagate. It has the benefit of avoiding accidental errors e.g. related to precision loss.
