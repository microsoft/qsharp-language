# Type System

With the focus for quantum algorithm being more towards what should be achieved rather than on a problem representation in terms of data structures, taking a more functional perspective on language design is a natural choice. At the same time, the type system is a powerful mechanism that can be leveraged for program analysis and other compile-time checks that facilitate formulating robust code. 

All in all, the Q# type system is fairly minimalist, in the sense that there isn't an explicit notion of classes or interfaces as one might be used to from classical languages like C# or Java. We also take a somewhat pragmatic approach making incremental progress, such that certain construct are not yet fully integrated into the type system. An example are functors, which can be used within expressions but don't yet have a representation in the type system. Correspondingly, they cannot currently be assigned or passed as arguments. There are similar loose ends related to type parametrized callables - a concept that is not commonly introduced as early as in the first version of a new language. While there is good reason for that, we strike a balance between making good design calls aligning with the principles outlined [here](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language/tree/main#design-principles) and user expectations that often compare against the functionalities available in well-established classical languages.
