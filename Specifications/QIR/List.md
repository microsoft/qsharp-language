|--------------|-------------|------|------|
| DM-Sim       | DM-Sim is a density matrix quantum circuit simulator for multi-GPU accelerated HPC clusters. DIM-Sim is able to scale out to more than a thousand GPUs on ORNL Summit supercomputer, and is able to quickly simulate deep circuit with more than 1 million gates. DM-Sim supports Microsoft Q# through QIR, and IBM Qiskit & Google Cirq through OpenQASM. DIM-Sim provide easy-to-use Python API and C++ API. | Sriram Krishnamoorthy, Ang Li, Bo Fang | https://github.com/pnnl/DM-Sim/blob/master/doc/paper_sc20.pdf |
| QCOR         | QCOR is a C++ language extension and associated compiler implementation for heterogeneous quantum-classical computing. QCOR builds off the XACC framework and extends plugin interfaces from Clang to enable quantum kernel expression, compilation, and execution on currently available physical (and virtual) quantum backends. | Alex McCaskey, Thien Nguyen, Daniel Claudino, Anthony Santana, Hal Finkel, Tyler Kharazi, Dmitry Liakh | https://github.com/ornl-qci/qcor |
