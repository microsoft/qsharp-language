## Identifiers

Identifiers in LLVM begin with a prefix, '@' for global symbols and '%' for
local symbols, followed by the identifier name.
Names must be in 8-bit ASCII, and must start with a letter or one of the special
characters '\$', '_', '-', and '.'; the rest of the characters in the name must
be either one of those characters or a digit.
It is possible to include other ASCII characters in names by surrounding the name
in quotes and using '\\xx' to represent the hex encoding of the character.
LLVM has no analog to namespaces or similar named scopes that are present in
many modern languages.

To the extent possible, symbols in the QIR should have identifiers that match
the identifier used in the source language.
The identifiers of local symbols should be converted to LLVM by merely adding the
'%' prefix.
If necessary, a suffix of ".." followed by an integer may be used to avoid name
clashes.
Anonymous local variables generated by the compiler can be represented
as %0, %1, etc., as is usual in LLVM.

Similarly, global symbols should have their identifiers converted by adding the
'@' prefix.
If the source language provides a named scoping mechanism, such as Python modules
or Q# namespaces, then the fully-qualified name of the global symbol should be used.
